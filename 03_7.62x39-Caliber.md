# Shooting a seed plate with the 7.62x39 caliber SKS
The 9mm seems like it would have been effective enough if the gun hadn't been bent and caused me to miss so many times. But we'll just have to imagine what the 9mm damage would have been with a direct hit. I think it would have pierced the plates. Next, we stepped it up to 7.62x39 with an SKS rifle.
