# 9mm 
The .22 wasn't quite destructive enough. The bullets didn't even pierce the plates. That says a lot for the plates! In this next video we stepped it up to 9mm. Unfortunately, we only had 8 bullets and I missed 7-1/2 times. We even drove into the nearest town trying to get more 9mm ammo but the local sporting goods dealer made it sound as though the whole state of Colorado was fresh out.
